# Container
Container in go

We expand on the Talk of Liz Rice and her sequel on 'Containers from scratch'

- Namespaces
- Rootless containers
- Cgroups
- Attacks like : 
	- Fork bomb (this is what Liz tries after she establishes the CGroups)

- We will transform this sample program into a strongly isolated container.

It will be run directly like `docker run`.
